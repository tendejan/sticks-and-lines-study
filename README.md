test_dataset was computed with random rotations and the process can be seen in ./src/generate_test_dataset.ipynb

visual_check_dataset was computed with fixed interval angles and the process can be seen in ./src/generate_visual_check_dataset.ipynb

renditions were generated based on the rotation matrix
